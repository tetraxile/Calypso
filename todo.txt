[-] net
  [-] server -> switch (8171)
    [x] make connection
    [x] implement packets
    [x] send STAS files to client
      [x] implement chunking of scripts
    [ ] start/stop script from server as well as from debug menu

  [-] server -> browser (8172: http, 8173: ws)
    [x] send browser button presses to server
    [x] host html locally
    [-] different packet types
      [x] script packet (info, data)
      [ ]

[-] scripts
  [x] receive script from server
  [x] save script locally
  [x] run script
    [x] disable user input while script is running (still allow them to control menu)
  [ ] pause/stop script midway through
  [ ] camera independent scripts (i.e. freecam during script execution)
  [ ] game-specific commands
    [ ] teleporting
    [ ] modifying HP
  [x] only read frames when scene is active (hook al::Scene::movement?)

[-] make debug menu
  [x] design
    [x] navigation
    [x] cell-based
    [x] background
  [x] support adding different types of cells / submenus
  [ ] add server connection dialog
    [ ] save server IP to local file
  [x] log
    [ ] word wrap
  [ ] toasts/notifications?
  [ ] other visualizers? e.g. hitsensors
  [ ] add more user feedback (e.g. "Loading...", etc.)
  [x] input display
  [-] frame advance
    [ ] if game is paused, draw frame's texture to framebuffer in order not to have debug menu remnants
    [ ] BUGFIX: input doesn't play when frame advancing

[ ] savestates (part of script format? or just game save files as part of format?)
  [ ] position, rotation, animation, camera state, 
  [ ] assign a frame index of script to the savestate
  [ ] allow selecting objects to save

[ ] (python) switch from threading to asyncio

[ ] test on all game versions

[ ] converter from other script formats to stas format?
    could be good to reduce the number of programs the user needs to use
    and helps to provide good testing material to see if converted scripts don't desync
    but also requires more maintenance if other formats continue to be used/updated
