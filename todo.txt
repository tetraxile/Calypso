  [ ] other visualizers? e.g. hitsensors
  [ ] add more user feedback (e.g. "Loading...", etc.)

[ ] savestates (part of script format? or just game save files as part of format?)
  [ ] position, rotation, animation, camera state, 
  [ ] assign a frame index of script to the savestate
  [ ] allow selecting objects to save

[ ] test on all game versions

[ ] converter from other script formats to stas format?
    could be good to reduce the number of programs the user needs to use
    and helps to provide good testing material to see if converted scripts don't desync
    but also requires more maintenance if other formats continue to be used/updated

[ ] make `deploy` folder for easier sending mod to switch (note that `sys/tools/deploy.py` exists)
